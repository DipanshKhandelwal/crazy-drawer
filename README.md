## Technologies Used
This project leverages the following cutting-edge technologies to deliver a seamless experience:
- [Expo](https://expo.dev/): A framework for universal React applications.
- [@react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/): A library for routing and navigation in React Native apps.
- [@react-navigation/bottom-tabs](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/bottom-tab-navigator/): For creating bottom tab navigators.
- [@react-navigation/drawer](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/drawer-based-navigation/): For implementing drawer-based navigation.
- [react-native-reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/): For creating smooth animations.

## Getting Started
Follow these simple steps to get up and running with this project:

1. **Install the necessary dependencies:**

   Open your terminal and run the following command to install all required packages:

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

2. **Start the application:**

   Once the dependencies are installed, start the application with:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

## System Overview
This project is designed to provide a flexible and dynamic user interface using React Native. It utilizes a combination of navigation libraries and animation tools to create a responsive and engaging user experience. The architecture is modular, allowing for easy customization and scalability.

## Approach to Navigation
This project adopts a robust approach using React Navigation to handle both simple and nested routes efficiently. By integrating both drawer and tab navigators, it provides users with intuitive navigation options:

- **Drawer Navigation**: Offers a side menu for easy access to different sections of the app. This is particularly useful for primary navigation.
- **Tab Navigation**: Provides a bottom tab bar for quick switching between key screens.

### Animation Wrapper
To enhance the user experience, this project implements an animation wrapper using `react-native-reanimated`. This wrapper handles animations for both simple and nested routes within the drawer navigation, ensuring smooth transitions and a polished look.

## Optimal Code Approach
Rather than building everything from scratch, this project improves upon existing libraries to achieve an optimal code approach. This allows leveraging the strengths of well-established libraries while customizing them to meet specific needs. This strategy not only saves development time but also ensures reliability and maintainability.
